    <ti tle>G3:  Version 7 of Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale Now Available</title>
    <lin k>http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=24874</link>
    <desc ription><![CDATA[Like its predecessors for Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale aims to restore content and quests that were omitted from the game as shipped. The additional content in this mod is based on what I can piece together from various game resources and from talking with former developer JE Sawyer on the Obsidian forums. Version seven features two new components--The High Baptist's Flock and Restored Random Drops--a new German translation, an expansion of the Minor Item Restorations component along with some miscellaneous bugfixes.<ul class='bbc'><li><a href='http://www.gibberlings3.net/ub_iwd/index.php' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Learn more about the mod </a><br /></li><li><a href='http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=152' class='bbc_url' title=''>Mod forum</a><br /></li><li><a href='http://www.gibberlings3.net/readmes/readme-ub_iwd.html' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>View the Readme </a><br /></li><li><a href='http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?app=downloads&showcat=34' class='bbc_url' title=''>Download the mod</a></li></ul>]]></description>
